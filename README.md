# findnorthpoledistance
This code calculates the distance from the North Pole to the specified country.

The haversine formula is used to calculate the distance between two sets of latitude and longitude coordinates. The code uses the latitude and longitude of the North Pole as a fixed point, and looks up the latitude and longitude of the specified country. You will need to provide a way to look up the coordinates of the country. For example, you could use a library like GeoPy or OpenCage Geocoder. The function returns the distance in miles.
